# Basic Traffic Light
A Python project to simulate a traffic light using Arduino and the Pymata4 library.

## Features
- Simulates traffic light behavior for a specified number of cars.
- Uses an Arduino to control the lights via digital output.

## Usage
- Input the number of cars waiting at the traffic light when prompted.
- Watch the lights change based on the cars remaining.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pymata4 library
- Arduino board & cable
- 3 LEDs representing traffic light colours

## How to Run
1. Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. Connect LEDs to Arduino digital pins.
3. Install the required Python libraries:
  - pip install pymata4
5. Run the script using `python traffic_light.py`.
